# JavaLessons

This repository contains a series of Java programming lessons, organized by topic and difficulty. Each lesson folder includes exercises and example code to help you learn and practice Java concepts.

## Structure

- **lesson01**: Basic Java syntax and introductory exercises
- **lesson02**: Data types, conversions, and simple operations
- **lesson03**: Operators, comparisons, and logical expressions
- **lesson04**: Control flow (loops, conditionals, break/continue)
- **lesson05**: Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
- **lesson06**: Object-oriented basics (classes, objects, packages)
- **lesson07**: Constructors, method overloading, and more OOP concepts
- **lesson08**: Access control, nested classes, and arrays of objects
- **lesson09**: Static methods, variables, and command-line arguments
- **lesson10**: Advanced exercises and topics

Each lesson contains a `src` folder with Java source files for exercises and examples. Some lessons include subfolders for specific topics or projects.

## How to Use

1. Open the lesson folder you want to study.
2. Explore the `src` directory for Java files.
3. Read, run, and modify the code to practice and understand the concepts.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) or a text editor and command line

## Getting Started

To compile and run an exercise:

```sh
javac path/to/YourFile.java
java YourFile
```

Replace `path/to/YourFile.java` with the actual path to the Java file you want to run.
